# Introduction to Pract


Pract is a _declarative_ UI engine for Roblox.

Pract takes inspiration from Facebook's [React](https://reactjs.org/), and LPGHatGuy's [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact), with an emphasis on providing **practical** features for bringing Roblox UI projects to life while still maintaining Roact's declarative code style.

Full guide with core concepts and usage examples coming soon.
