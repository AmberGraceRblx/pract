# Introduction to Pract

> Note: Intermediate knowledge of Roblox's [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) langauge is required to use this library. Knowledge of how to use Roact is also helpful to understand how and why to use Pract in your project, but is not required.

Pract is a **declarative** UI engine for Roblox, written in Roblox's [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/)

Pract takes inspiration from Facebook's [React](https://reactjs.org/) and LPGHatGuy's [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact), with an emphasis on providing **practical** features for bringing Roblox UI projects to life while still maintaining Roact's declarative code style.

Pract allows you to design your UI entirely in code, use a template designed in roblox's UI editor, or a mix of both. This documentation will show usage examples and detail how to effectively design your own UI code with the library's features.
