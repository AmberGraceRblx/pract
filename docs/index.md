# Introduction to Pract


Pract is a _declarative_ UI engine for Roblox.

Pract takes inspiration from Facebook's [React](https://reactjs.org/), and LPGHatGuy's [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact), with an emphasis on providing **practical** features for bringing Roblox UI projects to life while still maintaining Roact's declarative code style.

Full guide with core concepts and usage examples coming soon.

## Getting Started

You can install the Pract library by downloading [the latest rbxm release on Github](https://github.com/ambers-careware/pract/releases/) and inserting it into your experience.

Alternatively, you can copy the `Pract` folder from this repository into your project on your filesystem, and sync the files into your project using [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo)
