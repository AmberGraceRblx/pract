2. Right click the object in the Roblox Studio Explorer that you want to insert Pract into (such as ReplicatedStorage) and select `Insert from File...`
3. Locate the rbxm file that you downloaded and click `Open`


### Method 2: Syncing via Rojo
1. Install [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) and initialize your game as a Rojo project if you have not already done so
1. Download [the latest Source Code release (zip file) on Github](https://github.com/ambers-careware/pract/releases/)
