# Pract API reference

> Warning: API Documentation is still a work in progress, and Pract's feature set has not yet been finalized.

Hooks are a functions that can be called inside component functions. They allow you to use state and other Pract features without wrapping your component in a HOF or class.

Some hooks have a [React equivalent](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html); refer to the React documentation for best-practices and function

The current list of hooks added to Pract in 0.9.13 is as follows:

# Pract.useState
# Pract.useEffect
# Pract.useMemo
# Pract.useSignalUpdates
# Pract.useConsumer

The following functions are also added:
# Pract.createContext
# Pract.createHook

Full documentation is coming soon.
