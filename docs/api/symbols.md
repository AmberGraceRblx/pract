# Pract Symbols

> Warning: API Documentation is still a work in progresss!

See: [Events and Symbols](../basic/eventssymbols) for a more in-depth guide on how to use the basic Pract symbols

## Pract.None

Represents a value that should be assigned to "nil" on a decorated instance, since Pract cannot read the literal value `nil` as a table value in props.
