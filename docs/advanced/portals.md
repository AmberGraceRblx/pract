# Pract.portal

Sometimes, our UI tree might have a reason not to look like a pure top-down instance heirarchy. A good example of this is having BillboardGuis tied to our HUDâ€”we want these to appear and disappear based on whether or not our HUD is visible, but BillBoardGui objects need parts parented to `workspace` in order to function!

`Pract.portal` allow us to set an arbitrary _host instance_ for child elements to decorate or be parented to as the first argment. The second argument is a table of children.

```lua
-- This component creates a BasePart with a nametag BillboardGui when mounted.
local function HUDMarker(props: {position: Vector3, text: string})
    return Pract.stamp(script.MarkerPart, {
        CFrame = CFrame.new(props.position)
    }, {
        BillboardGui = Pract.index {
            Nametag = Pract.decorate({
                Text = props.text,
            })
        }
    })
end

-- This component creates a portal that mounts its children to workspace instead of our GUI tree!
local function HUDMarkers(props: {})
    return Pract.portal(workspace, {
        Marker1 = Pract.create(HUDMarker, {
            position = Vector3.new(0, 20, 0),
            text = "Now that's thinking with Portals!",
        })
    })
end

-- Our MainHUD is purely a ScreenGui tree, but ties our HUDMarkers visibility to its visibility!
local function MainHUD()
    return Pract.stamp(script.MainHUDTemplate, {
        -- ...
    }, {
        HUDMarkers = Pract.create(HUDMarkers)
    })
end
```
